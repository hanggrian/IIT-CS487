## Section 1

The software development approach our team picked started with the iterative
model, though somewhat agnostically as we were still learning about each
member's personality and preferences. With the iterative model, we can worry
about each of our contributions to the project rather than the structure and
workflow.

However, during the design phase, it is clear to us that time is running out. We
switched our approach to Extreme Programming, prioritizing a working build above
everything else. We created a prototype using proprietary *Adobe XD*, a
graphical UI/UX designer. An Android application is then written based on the
design blueprint, and delivered to the customer as a demo version.

## Section 4

I learn that, during an argument, it is wiser to find a middle ground than waste
time proving your point, regardless of the point's value. The situation is
exacerbated further on a tight deadline project such as this one. I also learn
that an argument is bound to happen, no matter how well the team's synergy is.
It's best to prepare for such a situation.

## Section 5

I will definitely remember the different types of software programming
approaches. For example, this project would not have been possible without a
basic understanding of XP. In the future, I will decide upon it before doing any
actual work.
