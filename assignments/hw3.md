# [Homework 3](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS487/blob/assets/assignments/hw3.pdf)

> Consider a control system which relies on sensors and systems to automatically
  manage an office building:
>
> - Prevents unauthorized access and allows authorized access.
> - Notifies the fire department if it “thinks” there may be a fire.
> - Notifies the police if it “thinks” there is an intruder.
> - Keeps the temperature “comfortable”.

## Problem 1

> Draw a context model capturing the system and its “partners”.

## Problem 2

> Create a table identifying
>
> 1. each state the control system can be in and
> 2. each possible outward transition – both catalyst and destination

| State | Transition |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

## Problem 3

> Describe a control panel which will support the user interactions noted above.

-

## Problem 4

> Develop a set of minimal binary commands to support all necessary signaling
  between the control system and its partners.

```
```

## Problem 5

> Use pseudo-code to describe how your system will detect and handle a failure
  of any of the partners

```
```
