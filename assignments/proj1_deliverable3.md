### Documentation

A homework calendar holds significant value as it serves as a practical
organizational tool for students. By maintaining a homework calendar, students
can effectively manage their time and stay on top of their academic
responsibilities. It allows them to track assignment due dates, exam dates, and
other important deadlines in a centralized manner. With a homework calendar,
students can prioritize tasks, plan their study schedules, and allocate time
accordingly, thereby reducing stress and enhancing productivity. It also
promotes better time management skills, accountability, and discipline. Our
application fills this role perfectly by utilizing a mobile platform to keep any
users updated at any point in time. This application was created in Android
Studio, using Kotlin, a high-level programming language that utilizes Java with
type interface. This application is capable of creating and storing accounts as
well as adding, viewing, and deleting homework utilizing local file storage on
the device. We also utilized database fragments when creating our application
because android has a built-in database function. The calendar functionality
would be implemented in future updates, but currently does not exist due to time
constraint.
