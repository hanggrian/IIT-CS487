## Problem 1

> Describe the purpose of each of the following phases: analysis, design, build,
  verify, release, maintenance.

| Phase | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Analysis | |
| Design | |
| Build | |
| Verify | |
| Release | |
| Maintenance | |

## Problem 2

> Every development effort will end with UAT - explain.

## Problem 3

> Consider the iterative approach

### Subproblem 3A

> Explain why it is logical to assume that each iteration will bring the
  development closer to 100% successful completion.

### Subproblem 3B

> Give one reason why this desired continuous progress may not happen and
  describe a way to ensure that it will.

### Subproblem 3C

> Explain why the iterative approach may take longer to complete than the
  schedule allows and describe a way to minimize this possibility.
