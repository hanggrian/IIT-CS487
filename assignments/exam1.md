> might impact the user's Level 3 SA?
>
> 1. Whether or not the user had a good night's sleep.
> 2. The time required for signals to travel between the user and the drone.
> 3. The speed at which the drone is flying.
> 4. The effectiveness of the training session which taught the user how to
    operate the system.
> 5. All of the above.

**B**. The time required for signals to travel between the user and the drone.

## Problem 11

> A user interface which forces the user to push a button to stop an alarm from
  sounding is an example of which of the following?
>
> 1. A way for the system to become more aware of the user's awareness.
> 2. The user's artificial intelligence.
> 3. An ambiguous non-functional requirement.
> 4. A design tradeoff resulting in increased risk exposure.
> 5. None of the above.

**A**. A way for the system to become more aware of the user's awareness.

## Problem 12
