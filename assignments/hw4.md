# [Homework 4](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS487/blob/assets/assignments/hw4.pdf): Modeling awareness

> You are designing a wearable device which must make the wearer acceptably

>
> - An internal health condition
> - An immediate external safety threat
> - Disinformation intended to destabilize society

## Problem 1

> Describe each of your chosen threats and assess its risk to the wearer.

## Problem 2

> Specify the devices partners and the CCI protocol for each interface.

## Problem 3

> Describe a metric or metrics for specifying SA in each case.

## Problem 4

> Specify the HCI which will provide acceptable SA of both the wearer and the
  device.

## Problem 5

> Describe a test strategy to “prove” [#4](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS487/blob/main/assignments/hw4.md#problem-4).
